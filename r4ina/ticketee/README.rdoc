=== About ERB file in sublime
ERB file could be set to either ERB or Rails -> HTML(Rails). If you have Ruby on Rails snippets installed through Package Control, link_to method in ERB file is shown in blue. If you have ROR snippets installed but through manually pulling from Github, link_to method in ERB file is shown in white. This method is in white under all other conditions that I'm aware of.

ERB Snippets package only functions in Rails -> HTML(Rails) format. It has different triggers than ERBAutoComplete, which functions in ERB format.
